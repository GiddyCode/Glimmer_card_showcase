To get started with the project, you need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your system. You can follow the instructions on the Flutter website to download and install Flutter.

Run
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
to launch the app on your web browser.

That's it! You can now see the rotating Pokemon card in action and modify the code to your liking.
